# Spring Data

**Spring Data’s mission is to provide a familiar and consistent, Spring-based programming model for data access while still retaining the special traits of the underlying data store.**

**It makes it easy to use data access technologies, relational and non-relational databases, map-reduce frameworks, and cloud-based data services. This is an umbrella project which contains many subprojects that are specific to a given database. The projects are developed by working together with many of the companies and developers that are behind these exciting technologies.**

官网介绍：

Spring Data的使命是为数据访问提供熟悉且一致的基于Spring的编程模型，同时仍保留底层数据存储的特殊特性。

它使得使用数据访问技术，关系数据库和非关系数据库，map-reduce框架和基于云的数据服务变得容易。这是一个总括项目，其中包含许多特定于给定数据库的子项目。这些令人兴奋的技术项目背后，是由许多公司和开发人员合作开发的。
